    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>Pursuit7 Gaming was forged in the fire of competition, built on unwavering discipline, strategic mastery, and the relentless pursuit of excellence. We do not follow the meta — we define it. As the crowned team of esports, we stand not for fleeting wins, but for enduring dominance.</p>
      
      <p>Our foundation is precision. Every call, every rotation, every engagement is calculated with sovereign intent. We train not to react, but to dictate. In silence, we prepare. In chaos, we command.</p>
      
      <p>We compete not to participate, but to rule. Our legacy is not written in tournament brackets alone, but in the standards we set for professionalism, synergy, and competitive integrity across the scene.</p>
      
      <p>To wear the Pursuit7 name is to accept the burden of kingship — to lead when others hesitate, to execute when others falter, and to uphold a standard that inspires fear in rivals and reverence in followers.</p>
      
      <p>This is more than a team. This is a dynasty.</p>
