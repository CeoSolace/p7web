    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>Pursuit7 Gaming is not merely an esports organization — it is the reclamation of a throne. Born from the ashes of forgotten ambition and rebuilt upon the unshakable pillars of discipline, precision, and legacy, Pursuit7 stands as the definitive embodiment of competitive sovereignty in modern esports.</p>

      <p>Our story begins not with a roster, but with a vision: to restore kingship to a domain that had grown complacent in mediocrity. In an era where talent is abundant but leadership is scarce, Pursuit7 emerged not to join the race — but to end it. We are the standard. We are the benchmark. We are the kings returned.</p>

      <p>Every member of Pursuit7 is selected not for raw mechanical skill alone, but for their ability to think, adapt, and execute under the weight of expectation. Our in-game philosophy is built on three immutable doctrines: strategic foresight, seamless cohesion, and unwavering composure. We do not react to the meta — we dictate it. We do not chase patches — we master them before they go live.</p>

      <p>Our command structure is hierarchical, yet fluid — a reflection of battlefield realism. The IGL is not a caller; they are the general. Players are not individuals; they are instruments of a singular will. This is not a team of stars. This is a symphony of execution, where ego is silenced and unity is absolute.</p>

      <p>Off the server, our commitment to professionalism sets us apart. We maintain rigorous training schedules, psychological resilience protocols, and performance analytics that rival elite military units. We treat competition not as entertainment, but as warfare — and warfare demands preparation, not improvisation.</p>

      <p>Pursuit7’s legacy is not measured in tournament wins alone, though those are many. It is measured in the fear we instill in opponents who know they face not just skilled players, but a dynasty reawakened. It is measured in the way other orgs adjust their entire strategies upon hearing our name in the bracket. It is measured in the silence that falls across voice comms the moment our logo appears on the broadcast.</p>

      <p>We do not seek popularity. We seek dominance. We do not court fans. We command respect. And while others build brands, we build empires — brick by brick, match by match, reign by reign.</p>

      <p>This is the remake of the kings’ team. Not a reboot. Not a rebrand. A restoration. Pursuit7 Gaming does not rise again — we simply remind the world that we never fell.</p>

      <p>The crown was never lost. It was merely waiting for us to reclaim it.</p>
